            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

            "title": "Think Big - Vision vs. Idea",
            "content": "As some of you might know my PhD research is also all about tech startups. As part of it I talk to and interview a lot of founders all over the world. A lot of people know that most parts of a startup including a lot of the ideas change quite significantly, especially in the first years of business. However, often times there’s a core idea or vision that always stays the same. This vision is what guides the startup through the ups and downs of the real world and what keeps it on track, while dynamically iterating on and validating its business model. . On my trip to Silicon Valley in May, I realized that there’s a lot more people there that, even if they are still just working on a small first product, have a big vision behind their startup. This vision is the core of their startup and it is the core of what they are passionate about. It is what motivates them day to day and it is what people will see and feel when talking to them. The vision of an entrepreneur is their “reality distortion field”, it is what convinces their cofounders, employees, advisors, angels, and investors to stick with them. In the end it is one of the fundamental building blocks that makes a startup successful. . Here in Germany, however, I often see early stage startups with decent ideas, but lacking big visions behind them. Some founders might have lots of ideas or lots of “functionality” that they want to add to their products, but often there’s no real big goal in terms of “we want to make a dent in people’s lives”. The lack of a strong core idea is one of the reasons these startups might fail. When they get to the limits of their idea and the market doesn’t accept it like they thought it would, these startups struggle keeping alive. It is harder for them to change course, cause the limited field of view that the small idea gives them doesn’t allow for radical changes. Often times the founders don’t see how they can recycle team, technology, customers, and/or partners into a new idea. They also might miss opportunities to claim completely new business areas with their existing products. A great example for latter is mytaxi, which expanded their core product (a peer-to-peer marketplace for personal transport) to the field of intra-day-logistics by using their existing resources (taxis and their drivers) to deliver packages quickly – no drones needed. . Having a big vision is also important when pitching. It makes it easier to convince your audience that it is worthwhile listening to you. It gives your maybe still small or non-existent product a context that makes it more attractive. It shows the core of your passion and motivation behind the startup. This is even more important in short format pitches like an elevator pitch. . Our vision is to … We do this by … Here is [the product] . Conveying your vision is very close to working with the “Golden Circle” by Simon Sinek. You “start with the why”, which should be your vision, then go on explaining the how, and finally finish with the what – your product. Not the other way around! .",

            "title": "Knowledge Worker Productivity Revisited",
            "content": ". Nearly a year ago I published a post called Knowledge Worker Productivity (read it if you haven’t, yet). Over the last year a lot of friends told me how they especially liked this one post and looking back at what I wrote last year I decided to post an update as to what has changed in my routine since then. . First, note that I’m still kind of an information addict and read a lot for work and also in my “free time”. The information I consume might  be a bit too much for many of you. However, this doesn’t mean the tools and methods I use won’t be helpful for your purposes. . So again, like in my last post, I’ll go into a bit more detail on the tools and methods I use and how I usually use them. However, to keep this post shorter, I will omit some things I wrote about last time. So if you haven’t read the last post, go read it now. . Disclaimer: All of these are my personal preferences. It is just a selection that works very good for me (for now and until I find something better). As I work with three Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro) the selection is biased towards tools that work on these, but most of them should be available on Android, Windows, or at least (mobile) Web, too. Enjoy! . Todo . As I wrote last time, I’m never really satisfied with any todo app and I have to say I still haven’t found the perfect one. Producteev still strangely is missing the functionality of sorting todos by due date AND priority. Astrid, which I was using last time around has been shut down, so I went back to the old-school Remember The Milk, which is paid, but has all the functionality I need – especially “language shortcuts”, priorities, tags/lists. It still misses a Mac app, but the website is an ok alternative. I still like the design of Any.DO and Wunderlist better, but the former isn’t available for desktop (only a Chrome plugin) and the latter makes me miss some things I got used to, maybe the update that will be coming today will change that. . Tool of choice: RTM . Alternatives: Any.DO, Wunderlist . Notes . I am still using Evernote for all my note taking activity. What has changed in the last year, is that the Evernote ecosystem has grown and more and more apps integrate with it. Also, Evernote itself has bought/built several nice apps that integrate nicely with the main app. Instead of simply taking pictures of my business cards and tagging them in Evernote, I now use Evernote Hello, which essentially does the same but with some added functionality. However, it ties the business cards to a location or event, which doesn’t work for me, as I scan them in the office or at home. It also doesn’t allow for normal Evernote tags so I have to tag the cards in the comments to the “event”. Then there’s Penultimate, which is an iPad app for taking notes with a pen. I use this in meetings, where I want to quickly jot things down, like when I coach startups. The browser plugin still works nicely and for everything else there’s the option to email notes in, which I found out can be directly put into notebooks and tagged through adding @notebook #tag to the subject line of the Mail. And last but not least Evernote has established itself so far that a lot of the apps I talk about further down (e.g. Reeder) have an Evernote integration right in the app. In this light there’s no real alternative in my eyes. . Tool of choice: Evernote . Supportive: Hello, Penultimate . News and Social Media (aggregation &amp; discovery) . What has changed here since last time is that I now use even less tools and try to stay away from too much information to save time. A big chunk of my daily information intake now goes through Facebook. Yes, it can be the procrastination tool number one, but you can also use it to get a quick overview of what’s happening and what to read. This might not work for everyone, but at least with the diversity in friends I have in my Facebook I get a very well curated feed of news and articles that make up my day-to-day reading list. This is mainly driven by several friends, who post very interesting stuff (Thanks guys!), supplemented by following some of the blogs I used to have in my RSS. I use Facebook mainly through its iPad app and open articles directly into my Safari, which I use to sync a reading list with all my devices. These are usually the articles I read throughout the week, whenever I have time. . I don’t use News360 anymore and neither Prismatic. I still really like both apps, but I have not much use and time for them anymore. . Then I still use Flipboard to aggregate my Weibo feed. However, I started un-following a lot of people, so I get an overview pretty quick. From time to time I also look into the curated topics as well as the Hackernews Account and my Twitter feed aggregated, but I keep that to times when I see that I have more time for reading or didn’t quench my thirst through any other channels. . Additionally, I have started using Umano, which is “Audiobooks for Articles”. It has a list of articles from popular blogs in tech, health, and other sectors, which are read by real people. Users can browse those from the app and add them to a playlist. They also send a weekly newsletter with trending articles, but individualized to the users listening habits, which I usually use to add 2-3 to my playlist. The app can then download the playlist for offline use and I can listen to those articles, while doing other things. . Tools of choice:  Flipboard, Umano, Facebook . News (RSS) . By now Google Reader is dead. However, many alternatives took its place. I won’t go into detail on any of the alternatives. Suffice to say for my usage the free Feedly is working quite well. I don’t like the reading experience of it, but I use it mostly as a backend to now freshly updated Reeder 2 on iPhone and iPad. Reeder is still the best app in that space and I hope the Mac app will get out soon. My routine hasn’t changed much here. I go through my feeds on iPhone or iPad and either read articles directly, leave them for later in the starred list or push longer reads over to my reading list app. . Tools of choice: Reeder, Feedly . Reading List . Nothing much has changed in this space – I still use Instapaper. However, Pocket is a very good alternative here. Readability shouldn’t be much inferior, but I’ve never used it. . Tool of choice: Instapaper . Alternatives: Pocket, Readability . Mail . This section was missing last year as I wasn’t counting email into productivity. However, especially in light of many people being overwhelmed by email, I feel I should also write some lines about it. I never had much email overload, but still I was jealous of some friends regularly achieving inbox zero. I am with Mann here in that inbox zero is not always having really 0 emails in your inbox, but about “how much of your own brain is in that inbox”. So, what what I did was disable any kind of push notifications for emails on all devices and in all apps. Especially on my MacBook I don’t see even any badges visible while I’m working. I just check my mails every now and then in between tasks. I also never use mails as todos – if I can’t act on a mail in the next 1-2 hours I create a task for it in my todo app. . I also unsubscribed from a lot of mails (mailing lists, newsletters, notifications) and I still keep doing that a lot. Then I use Unroll.me, which aggregates unimportant mails out of your mailbox and presents them once a day in a neat overview mail to you. I also started using Mailbox, to archive and postpone mails getting to real inbox zero about once every week or so. Still, I also use the iOS Mail app a lot, as it’s the quickest option and the only one supporting Exchange, which I need for part of my work. On my MacBook, I use either Apple’s Mail app or Airmail, which is basically similar to what Sparrow used to be before they got bought by Google. They recently even introduced Exchange support, which is still missing from Mailbox and most other apps. . Tools of choice: Unroll.me, Mailbox, Airmail, Mail.app . Inspiration . Last but not least, part of my daily information intake is what I would call “Inspiration”. As a knowledge worker I think it’s important to look into a variety of fields – not only the ones that you are working on. This and the fact that I really like Design makes Pinterest one of the apps I use nearly every day – quickly browsing through pins from people I follow and re-pinning stuff I like. Then there’s TED, which most of you should know. If not just go the website and watch some inspiring videos. Sure, there’s lots of critique against TED being elitist and filtering talks that are against some of its supporters. However, it’s still one of the best sources for inspiring videos that are between 5 and 15 minutes long and fit into any break or subway ride. Then, sure there’s also Facebook, where again the diversity and global diffusion of my friends makes for a great source of Inspiration from all kinds of areas. . Tools of choice: Pinterest, TED, Facebook .",

            "title": "From Beijing with Love - Introducing Cool People from the Beijing Startup Scene",
            "content": ". I haven’t been writing as much as I wanted lately, and even this piece I’m writing on the plane back to Germany. I had planned to write more in my three-week vacation after attending a workshop on cyber security in Beijing as I still have a backlog of drafts for this blog. Instead I took some time off, slept a lot, met a lot of old friends, had good food, and even partied a little. . However, I didn’t completely switch off. Even before I went to Beijing, I was planning to get back into the startup scene there – For those of you wondering why I write “back”: I used to live in Beijing for about two years and was already a bit involved in the startup scene back in 2009, the days of Web Wednesdays and Mobile Mondays. . Anyway, I assumed even a big metropolis like Beijing must have its core events and with that some core people, who keep the events and community running. I posted open questions in startup related LinkedIn groups and contacted some of the more “central” people directly on Twitter, Weibo, or even good old Email. As it seems to be the case with most startup communities I got quite some positive feedback and open invitations for coffee/lunch. I met most of those who replied and even many more who I either met on events, in coffee shops, was introduced to by others, or even knew from before. . I will write some more about connecting startup communities globally on our newly founded Cologne/NRW startup blog The Pirates Inn. . However, on this blog, I wanted to write a little about the people I’ve met. Beijing has once again proven that it has some great people and a great community. So to start building a bridge to our sister city , I want to introduce and thank some of the people I met in the last three weeks (in order of meeting them or at least how I remember it). This could get long… . Shlomo Freund Shlomo was the first one I met on this trip. We had exchanged some mails and tweets before and he seemed like a nice guy. We had some very interesting talks about his blog, the iOS app agency, where he’s the BizDev and our shared interest in lean startups. Further, he told me his wife (whom I met later at BarCamp) works at an app testing company, which seems to be a really good option in case you don’t happen to have 200 different Android phones in your startup to test on. He further introduced me to several other people and invited me to the last Startup Leadership Program session, where we had a great time playing “fake VC”, (fake) investing in real startups, and pitching our investment decision to real VCs. . Alex Miller I met Alex pitching us his new startup frogo.tv at SLP. Alex has lots of experience in the startup world and seems to know everyone in the scene, maybe also stemming from his former role as senior product manager for advertising at Renren (the Facebook of China). He’s a really cool guy and knows what he’s talking about, so I ended up “fake investing” in his company (and team). . Yoyao Hsueh Yoyao is the CEO and founder of mashup, another one of the startups at the SLP event. They went the lean way and started organizing real life events, then developed a tool for themselves and are now in the process of bringing that product to the public. I met Yoyao again later in my trip for a coffee and I hope they crush it. . Yan Chen Yan is Designer who aims to build a social marketplace for NGOs to sell their products. She was the third startup at SLP and deserves a lot of respect trying to do social entrepreneurship in a country and market like China. Really hope she gets traction. . Tayler Cox Tayler, who’s a portfolio manager at ZhenFund, was one of the real VCs at the SLP event. Even if we didn’t get to talk a lot, she offered great insight through her feedback. We didn’t get the chance to meet up again, but I hope to get the chance next time around. . Jason Lim Jason is one of the organizers of SLP and knows a lot of people in Beijing and China. He’s a freelance blogger for App Annie and an editor at TechNode. He’s also the founder of Koombah, a startup that helps with real estate in Beijing. We met shortly on several occasions, just cause Beijing is so small. I hope next time around we find some time to meet up not just accidentally. . Kevin Dewalt Kevin is another guy I found prior to going to Beijing, as he’s the organizer of the Lean Startup Meetup Beijing, which coincidentally Shlomo now is co-organizing. Kevin is a pro in terms of lean startup and tries to help as many entrepreneurs as possible with events and office hours. We directly connected as I’m a co-organizer of NEXT Cologne and he’s going to be the facilitator of NEXT Beijing starting in April. He also building a new tool for entrepreneurs who want to help others by offering easy to manage office hours. He introduced me to many other entrepreneurs in Beijing and we still keep regular contact. . Rick Bruderick Rick is an awesome guy with a huge heart. We met back in 2009 at one of the Web Wednesdays in Beijing. Back then he wanted to start a web site for cross cultural exchange and education. We set up a globally very distributed team, but didn’t end up implementing very far. Nowadays, he’s a teacher at an international school in Beijing, but his passion for cultural education hasn’t died. When we met he showed me his first alpha of a Cultural Inteligence app, which I will try helping him out with in the future. . Michael Wix Michael is another  awesome guy. He’s very diverse and full of knowledge. We met back in 2009 at the unhappy occasion of burying the ashes of our mutual friend Mike Martello. He has a blog about Chinese wrestling and works as a coach facilitating personal, team, and organizational performance. He’s also involved in some startup activity, which I hope to see getting out and successful sometime soon. . Bill Eng I met Bill at Mike’s place, where we were having pizza (and various alcoholic beverages). He’s a serial entrepreneur in Beijing. His various ventures, which he manages all at the same time, include companies sell cakes, bikes, MMA gear, and sidecars. . Luca Naso Luca is a researcher and astrophysicist at National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. When I met him we were talking about him wanting to start a company doing a online game which is different from anything seen before and about the frustration of publishing in the academic world. As I saw today on his LinkedIn profile, for now he started as the CTO of Edisonweb. Hope he will make his dent. . James Wicker James is also an Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He’s an Editor editor at the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics and one of the old Web Wednesday Beijing people from 2009. We met shortly on Barcamp, but didn’t find the time to meet up later again. Next time. . Andy Mok I was introduced to Andy on Barcamp, where he was speaking about how working at startups is more fulfilling than working for big corporations. . @andymok on why working at #startups is better than for big companies @ #barcampbeijing pic.twitter.com/jwxkBID9 . &mdash; Puja Abbassi (@puja108) January 27, 2013 . With his company Red Pagoda Resources, Andy helps VC backed startups hire talent. We had a nice talk and I hope we meet again soon. . David Lin David, who’s the director of Microsoft Accelerator in Beijing, was also the host for Barcamp Beijing this time. I was introduced by Shlomo based on our mutual interest in Food Supply Chain Security. We had a really nice talk about one of his startups, who focus on tracking and tracing in food supply chains in China. He made me think about and realize how different the market conditions in China are and how this opens up completely different and huge opportunities. . James Flanagan James is the lead organizer at Barcamp Beijing. He’s also team lead at TEDxBeijing the managing editor at Asia Healthcare Blog. We met actually on the BarCamp “after party/drink out” and had some discussions about success of startups and changing the world. . Pin Wang Pin, who I also met at/after Barcamp, is a freelance UX and product consultant with also a project of his own, helping people study and read Chinese. He used to be a producer at App Annie, which seems to be one of the most prominent employers in the Beijing startup scene, as I met so many people who were in some way or the other connected to it. . Brian Challberg Brian was also at Barcamp and seems to know everyone in the Chinese and Taiwanese startup scene. He’s VP of Business Development and Strategy at Accuvally and will co-organize NEXT Beijing. . Zhang Chao Another person I met at Barcamp is Chao. She’s freelance writer with a big dream of starting an NGO focusing on girls’ development and growth in China. You can follow her interesting endeavors on her Weibo. . Guy Taylor and Carl Robinson Guy and Carl were another pair of entrepreneurs I met at Barcamp (it was a 350 attendee event after all!). Their startup hyperlingo is a market place for global translation services, which is set to disrupt the sleeping translation market. . Piet Bos Piet is a WordPress guru and organizer of the WordPress meetup in Beijing, which is where we met. His company Senlin Online offers WordPress related services as well as SEO and social media strategy. . Jens Nielsen I met Jens at the WordPress meetup. He’s a great developer currently focussing on an online learning platform for international schools as part of Crystal Asia. . Nick McIntosh I got introduced to Nick through Kevin. We had lunch together and talked a lot about living in Beijing and the #airpocalypse. Nick is a Product Manager at App Annie and used to work in online marketing before. . Guy Sivan I met and got reintroduced to Guy, when having lunch with Kevin at Biteapitta, which seems to be like a central hub for startup lunch meetings in Beijing. We had actually met before in 2009, where he was giving a talk on learnings at his real estate startup at Web Wednesday Beijing. Nowadays he’s the co-founder of Vericant, a startup doing video prescreening for  Chinese applicants to foreign universities. . I apologize to anyone I met and didn’t have the time to get to know better to be able to write about or just shamefully forgot in this list (write me and I will add you!). And I hope that I will meet all of you Beijingers again someday soon and that you will make a dent. You are all awesome! Keep in touch. . With startup love from Cologne! .",

            "title": "Knowledge Worker Productivity",
            "content": "This post was inspired by some mails and discussions I had with colleagues and friends about how I cope with all the information I work with. Especially one colleague is always pushing me to make a presentation and/or blogpost about it. So first, here the blogpost and the presentation and respective slides will follow. . More and more of us are deeply dependent on information for our jobs or just out of interest. Even if we don’t call ourselves information workers or knowledge workers, some might say most of us already are. Even if not really dependent on it we get addicted to information consumption. This goes so far that people treat this addiction like obesity and recommend “information diets” or even “information fasting“. To be clear I’m a total information addict so far that my former advisor and good friend would say “Puja has two brains, one for normal life and one for all the information he consumes”. I have to say I was deeply addicted and most of it was because of RSS and that big bad number next to “unread” (similar to “Notification Badge Anxiety Disorder”). Still, I don’t (want to) believe RSS is dead (just yet). And based on the lack of good discovery and aggregation tools I didn’t want to give up all my feeds. With time, new services, and especially with the purchase of my iPad (with retina display “for better reading”) this has completely changed. Now I use a pletora of apps and tools that make my information consumption a lot lighter and more efficient. It might still be a bit too much for many of you, but then I’m an information freak. This doesn’t mean the tools and methods I use won’t be helpful for your purposes. . In the remainder of this post I’ll go into a bit more detail on the tools and methods I use (and their alternatives) and how I usually use them. . Disclaimer: All of these are my personal preferences and even if I mention alternatives (all of which I tried) the list of tools won’t be exhaustive. It is just a selection that works very good for me (for now and until I find something better). As I work with three Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Macbook Pro) the selection is biased towards tools that work on these, but most of them should be available on Android, Windows, or at least (mobile) Web, too. Enjoy! . Todo . I know todo lists might not be directly related to information, but for me, they’re an essential part of my professional (and sometimes even personal) life. I note every small todo into my list, even if it’s just something like “mail john about x” or “lookup book y” as soon as it pops into my mind, cause as fast as it pops in, it might fall out, too. This is also why I like to have some more functionality like lists and tags in my todo, so stuff I quickly added on a late night event will still have a context the next day or week. My days are usually very busy and no, I don’t think that’s great, but that’s how it goes when you have to juggle vastly different projects and still want to find time for sports (and my related blog) and friends/private life. My todo list is what keeps me sane. . I have to confess I switched todo apps a lot! I tried very simple and stylish ones like Any.DO and Wunderlist, but too simplistic doesn’t cut it for me. The tool I always get back to is Producteev, they have apps for any platform and lots of functionality, but still keep it simple. At the moment I’m trying out Astrid, which is very nice, but only offers a web version next to the mobile apps. This and some other small annoyances make me want to switch back to Producteev again. Another great feature, which Astrid is trying but hasn’t nailed down like Producteev (and RTM) yet, is what they call “language shortcuts”, which lets you specify tasks quickly right when you add them by using shortcuts for priority, tags, lists, etc. . Tools of choice: producteev, astrid . Alternatives: Any.DO, Wunderlist . Notes . Taking notes and organizing your thoughts or research is essential to a knowledge worker. Be it for taking notes at meetings and events, putting together research for projects or a report, or organizing thoughts and sources for a blog post or article. A good note taking app can help you in many ways. For me it’s especially important that it features a good tagging and search functionality as well as some simple way to structure content. I used to use MS OneNote a lot, but as it didn’t work on my iPhone, I was looking for something else. First I used a combination of Evernote for research and long time notes plus the iPhone notes app for short time on-the-fly notes. Then my iPhone backup got scrambled (that was before iCloud) and I lost some really important notes I had made on the beach in Qingdao, so I switched to Springpad, which is awesome for its live lookup of movies, books, wikipedia, etc. At some point I realized it might be better to just use one tool, so I consolidated everything into Evernote and that’s what I’m happily using for all of the above and even for organizing my business cards. I take pictures of them with my iPhone and tag and organize them afterwards. Evernote then makes them searchable through its OCR engine. The iOS apps still crash from time to time, but as they have a very robust syncing mechanism I don’t remember loosing anything. Evernote is integrated in many other apps and even has a very nice Browser plugin. For everything else there’s the option to email notes in. . Tool of choice: Evernote . Alternatives: Springpad, OneNote . News and Social Media (aggregation &amp; discovery) . Like I said I used to have lots of feeds in my RSS reader, cause I wanted to stay up-to-date on a lot of topics I’m interested in. However, that played out to a waste huge chunk of my time, so I was always looking for alternatives. I tried out many of the new news aggregation apps, but I got stuck on a mixture of three apps in the end. The first app I usually open (after Facebook and Mails) is News360. I used to have this app only for it’s ability to send really important global news (like the death of Kim Jong Il) as push messages really fast. However, with their new version they got a very nice aggregation algorithm that mixes news from various kind of topics and sources (not only tech) and gives the user a nice quick overview of what’s happening. They also got this funny gamification, which gives one to three stars for the amount of news you consume that day. Usually I just go till I get the first star, then I switch to Flipboard. Flipboard is beautiful and has a very nice aggregation algorithm that works awesomely with Social Media and actually anything you throw at it. I follow several of their curated topics, but mainly let Flipboard aggregate my Twitter, Instagram, and Weibo (“Chinese Twitter”) accounts as well as the Hackernews Twitter Account (they stopped having the feed in Flipboard). This gives me quite a lot of really nice reads (mostly through the people I follow on Twitter), which I sometimes read in app, but often export to some reading list (more on that later). I actually also use Facebook (through the iOS app or web) a lot for news discovery. I have a very diverse bunch of friends from all over the world, so my stream tends to bubble up a lot of cool stuff. Last but not least I have to mention Prismatic, which I use only when I have some more time. This doesn’t mean that it’s a bad app, actually it’s the best news discovery app on the market in terms of style and “bubble”-algorithm in my opinion. It learns really quickly what you like and gives you awesome suggestions. It even tries to get you out of your filter bubble by randomly (?) mixing in some few outlier suggestions and checking what you do with them. It learns passively from analyzing, which articles you open and/or share, but also actievly by letting you “+” or delete articles in the feed. However, it’s still very tech focussed. . The good thing about using these apps is that they give me a quick or deep overview depending on the time I can spare, but don’t give me any pressure through unread counters. . Tools of choice: News360, Flipboard, Prismatic, Facebook . Alternatives: Zite, Pulse, Thirst, Wavii, News.me, Taptu (friends works there), Twosift (a friend is the founder and I advise sometimes) . News (RSS) . That said, I still keep some (few) blogs I enjoy reading a lot in my RSS reader. For this I use Google Reader in combination with the Reeder app, which you have to buy seperately for each Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it’s totally worth it. I’ve never seen a better and more efficient UI for quickly scanning feeds. It even has Readability integration, which makes reading inside of it quite nice by itself. I usually go through the feeds on my iPhone during my short (20-30 min) commute to work. I scan through the feeds and mark interesting articles as starred. Sometimes I even read some directly. Later I go on to read the articles on the iPad or open some on my Macbook (usually only those that have todo with a Mac app or Chrome Plugin or coding). Those that I don’t want to read directly I either leave in the starred list or push over to my reading list app. . Tools of choice: Reeder, Google Reader . Alternatives: Best RSS Newsreaders by Lifehacker, nilter (from the department where I’m working at) . Reading List . For keeping articles to read later I use Instapaper. Like I said I push those articles over from Reeder, Flipboard, Web, or any other place I find them. Instapaper then lets me load them to read offline and in a clean layout on any device I have handy. I read them when I get some free time, which is not often nowadays so the backlog is huge. However, cause I know it might take some time till I get to my Instapaper, I open more interesting articles directly in Safari, which nowadays syncs flawlessly between all Apple devices. I then open and read them in between other tasks on the device I’m currently on. . Tool of choice: Instapaper . Alternatives: Pocket, Readability .",

            "title": "Is the OUYA going to kill Apple TV, Google TV, Nexus Q, and the HTPC all together?",
            "content": ". Yes, I know “the idea that one product will ‘kill’ another is plain wrong”, but bear with me here.  . Today I woke up with a message from my co-blogger from gongfubrother telling me about the new game console that’s been blowing up on kickstarter having raised $2 million on its first day (they had a goal of $950,000). OUYA is going to be an open game console based on Android 4.0 with a price-point of just $99 including a nice controller that even sports a touchpad. . As PandoDaily wrote earlier OUYA is going to compete against established players like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, all of which have support from the big game players in the market. However, I don’t think this comparison is fair, the competition to the established consoles is just in an indirect way. Independently developed games and ported mobile games, which will be the start of OUYA, don’t compete directly with the likes of Call of Duty, MW3 or Tekken. Rather, they compete on an indirect basis for the general attention and free time of people. They even plan to include a touchpad on the controller to ease the porting of games of smartphone games. This combined with the killer price of $99 and the geeky fact that everything is open (even rooting is allowed without voiding the warranty) are the perfect settings for killing it on kickstarter, where these kind of hardware (e.g. the Pebble watch) tend to go viral very fast. . However, my first thought was that finally someone made the Google TV device everyone is waiting for. Looking at the comments on kickstarter you can see a lot of people asking for XBMC or another kind of media center integrated. From a non- or casual-gamer perspective this would be a $99 HTPC with some free and cool additional gaming functionality. The price is very competitive comparing it to the $99 Apple TV, but even more looking at the Google TV devices out there (e.g. the $200 Sony NSZ-GS7) or that crazily overpriced Nexus Q – $300 for a device that is supposed to be a glorified “social AirPlay” device without any Google TV functionality, really Google!? . Also, with its open platform the OUYA enables anyone willing to extend it with soft- and hardware as they please. Even for hardcore Apple fans (like me) who are confined in their AirPlay world it would be a perfect companion to their (even jailbroken) AppleTV. Heck, it just needs to have a simple media center integrated to connect to your NAS and be able to run some Android apps like Twitter and Facebook and you have everything you always wished your Apple TV could do. Connect it to your Smartphone or Bluetooth Keyboard and you don’t even need the controller for inputting text, for everything else the touchpad on the controller does it, too. Maybe I could even connect it to my Pebble watch and control it from there. Integration with other projects (like RunKeeper) is nothing new for the Pebble team and even without direct collaboration there’s always the Pebble Android SDK. Now think one step further and have OnLive or some other cloud gaming service on it – suddenly killing traditional game consoles could be one step closer. . Just dreaming…but this could really get awesome! What do you think? .",

            "title": "Cologne Startup Scene - Whats Next?",
            "content": "Recently, the Cologne startup scene has been discussing how the startup ecosystem here can be further developed and what is missing to make Cologne more competitive nationally (against Berlin), but also internationally. This is how the new Facebook group Cologne Startups, which already has more than 500 members in less than two months, started. . In the last week Thomas Grota kicked of a discussion there titled “Thoughts on my balcony: ‘what’s next?’”, which is already around 100 comments long. Furthermore, we also discussed the case at the last Hacker News Meetup in Cologne (short summary can be found on Francis’ Blog). In this post, I will try summarize both discussions to give a better overview to people joining. I will quote a lot of different people, so forgive me if I forget some accreditation. If anyone misses their name somewhere please feel free to contact me. Same counts for anyone who wants their part anonymized or excluded. . First, we should mention that as Thomas wrote we already have several (co-)working places like Solution space, Coworking Cologne, betahaus, Friesenloft and the new clustehaus. We also have events like betapitch, (internationally renowned) European Pirate Summit, hopefully startupweekend Cologne soon and many more. However, there are some (interconnected) topics we still have to work on. . More Startups and Better Funding . Mainly kicked of by Francis Dierick we discussed a general problem with attitude in Cologne and Germany. He wrote: “it needs to become acceptable to fail. We need more people working on crazy ideas &amp; that’s only possible if there’s a safety net for failed startups.” Failure should be accepted “as a starting point, not the end.” There’s a general risk aversion in Germany that is present on both the VC’s and the entrepreneur’s side. Some entrepreneurs in Germany want to have total or at least near total security in case of failure. They want to keep their job or at least keep their lifestyle even after quitting. . One way to mitigate this risk is early stage funding. There’s a desperate need for early stage funding in Cologne, i.e. Angel and Seed stages. Even if startups can find funding, it’s sometimes at extortionate conditions nullifying any upside for the founders. Again Francis had a very nice comment on that: “[We need] funding from people who didn’t forget that the V in VC stands for adVenture capital. Sure, there’s money around, but in typical German style, none of that money wants to take a risk. No wonder then, that Germany is still known mostly for me-too startups.” . However, as Vidar Andersen said, many entrepreneurs try to get funding way too early. They don’t even think about the possibility to bootstrap their startup. Maybe more bootstrappers in our community should set an example and show that it is possible to work on their startup even without getting funding from the start. Even if we might scare off some people, those might be the ones not suited for being an entrepreneur anyway. . Better Connection to Universities and Students . There are already some good things going on fostering more entrepreneurship at Cologne universities. There’s steps2startup and hochschulgründernetz cologne that try to get together and educate students about entrepreneurship as well as several departments (incl. the one I work at) mentoring students and helping them with concretizing their ideas and applying for funding and scholarships like EXIST-Gründerstipendium for example. University of Cologne is also working on applying for another EXIST-Forschungstransfer. We also have many of Germany’s best tech and business schools/universities (University of Cologne, RWTH Aachen, WHU, Witten/Herdecke University, etc.) around Cologne. As Christoph Plamper puts it, “what really needs to happen is for universities to embrace startups and spin-offs as drivers for financing and innovating teaching and research.”, which is a thought that not only universities have to embrace, but also the startups coming out of the universities. The bond shouldn’t end the moment your startup can stay on its own feet. Startups should rather try to keep up this bond and increase cooperation with their roots. . Till Ohrmann wrote: “Many students are eager to connect with successfull entrepreneurs/BAs/VCs and really grateful for every contact. Before we loose them to the corporate world, we should give them the chance to see the startupworld 😉 It sounds a bit strange: but - with a little help from their friends (entrepreneurs/VCs) they can be the motor of every startup scene (event operations &amp; co.). Non-Profit from the beginning and then see what happens.” Others also agreed that the startup scene should make themselves more available to the next generation. Tom Bachem’s idea of a Startup University goes in the same direction. . Students and the next generation are important, but we also need to keep in mind that startups and being an entrepreneur are not for everyone. There’s a notion of romanticizing the life of an entrepreneur, so that we see more and more young (and old) self-proclaimed “founders” having this unrealistic image of startup life. When aiming to educate and mentor the next generation, we have to be sure to not hit the masses but the fewer ones really built to endure the hardships of bootstrapping and giving everything to make a little dent on this world. . Internships could come in handy here. As Johannes Nuenning wrote: “Well, how about creating (more) opportunities for students and pupils to practice and excercise? Why shouldn’t startups (and VCs) offer internships to pupils and students more frequently? Dedicated pitch sessions already suggested here could be another good playground for ‘beginners’ as well, in order to gain experience, fail (with little damage) and stand up again. Eventually, they’ll catch fire.”, which is also in line with a recent TechCrunch article on the importance of entrepreneurship experience for students. . More Inter-Connectedness . As I mentioned in the beginning, we already have many organizations and events in place. The next step here would be to connect across these to, as Marc Kley of hgnc wrote, “find synergies and maybe come up with one big thing further boosting Cologne as startup city.” This is also in line with a recent TechCrunch post, where Mike Butcher is asking for syncing up more of the European startup events so that especially attendees from overseas can maximize the utilization of their long trip to Europe. This would also help us foster more international connections to and accreditation by the already established places (e.g. Silicon Valley and Austin), people, and organizations. . We could also find a need for more connection between VCs, entrepreneurs, and the next generation maybe even on a regular basis. For this some suggested to establish a weekly lunch meetup, details of which will be discussed and published on Facebook soon. Further, we discussed opening up or at least making our events more attractive to people outside of tech. This would increase diversity and lead us to more learnings and maybe even surprising innovations. As Martin Riedel wrote: “cologne has several world class venture backed companies with entrepreneurs who have raised money big time in medtech, life science, etc. the key question for me is how to motivate these people to share their experience?” . Conclusion . We have a long way in front of us, but as some of the members already said, even Silicon Valley and Berlin took quite some time to develop and get where they are today. I for myself can say that I’m proud of this place and thoroughly impressed with the energy and talent I see these days in Cologne. Never would I have imagined such a “small” city to have this kind of huge potential. We just have to keep on working hard and step by step we can make our little (or maybe even bigger) dent on the world. . Thanks again to everyone, who contributed to this discussion. If you have any more thoughts on this matter, be sure to join the discussion in the Facebook Cologne Startups group. .",
